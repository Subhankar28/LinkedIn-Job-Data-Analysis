**LinkedIn Jobs Data Analysis**

In this Project I did an end-to-end analysis of LinkedIn's professional networking platform's Jobs section.
The project aims to extract over 500 job details from LinkedIn's website using the Python library, Selenium, and organize the information into specific formats by creating three tables.
Additionally, the project involved data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Numpy libraries. MS-Excel were utilized to derive insights from the dataset. 
Power BI was used to visualize the results.
